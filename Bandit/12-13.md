# Level 12 &rarr; Level 13

It is given that the password is contained in *data.txt*, but that *data.txt* is a hexdump of a file that were repeatedly compressed.

To solve this problem, *data.txt* is first copied to a temporary directory with write permission.
Next the binary is retrieved from the hexdump using the command `xxd -r data.txt > data.bin`.
From now on, the procedure is to check the filetype of the binary with the `file` command:
* If the file is gzip compressed data, the file gets the *.gz* suffix and is decompressed with the command `gunzip`. The filetype of the result is again checked.
* If the file is bzip2 compresed data, the file gets the '.bz' suffix and is decompressed with the command `bunzip2`. The filetype of the result is again checked.
* If the file is a tar archive, it gets decompressed with the command `tar -xvf`. The filetype of the result is again checked.
* If the file is ASCII text, we print the password with the command `cat`.
