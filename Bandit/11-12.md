# Level 11 &rarr; Level 12

It is given that the file *data.txt* stored the password, but all lowercase and uppercase letters have been rotated 13 positions.
The command `tr` can be used to translate the characters to their correct position by specifying that the letters have been moved 13 positions as two strings representing sets of letters:

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```

The password for level 12 is: 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
