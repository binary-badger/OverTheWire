# Level 18 &rarr; Level 19

It is known that the password for level 19 is stored in the *readme* file in the home directory.
But when we log in with SSH as user Bandit18, we are logged out with the message: "byebye !" due to a modification in the file *.bashrc*.

To solve this problem, we can issue a command that SSH executes immediatly when connecting.
If we set this command to `cat readme`, we can read the password to level 19 before we are logged out:

```
$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
$ 
```

The password for level 19 is: IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
