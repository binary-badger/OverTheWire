# Level 21 &rarr; Level 22

At this level we are informed that a program is running via `cron`, and that we can look in */etc/cron.d/* for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

We list the files in /etc/cron.d/*:

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d/
atop  cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24
```

We observe a number of files of which */etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22* is most likely the relevant file.
We read the content of the file:

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh 
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

We see that the program changes the permission of a file in */tmp/* such that it can only be written by the owner but can be read by anyone.
In the next line we see that the program writes the content of the password file for level 22 into the temporary file.
We should therefore be able to get the password for level 22 by reading that temporary file:

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
```

The password for level 22 is: Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
