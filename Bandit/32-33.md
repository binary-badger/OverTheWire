# Level 32 &rarr; Level 33

When we access level 32, we a greeted with "WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL", and we quickly discover that all letters in commands are in uppercase:

```
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> whoami
sh: 1: WHOAMI: not found
```

Luckily, neither the behavior of numbers or special characters have been changed.
We can therefore expand the name of the shell with `$0` so that we can escape the uppercase shell:

```
>> $0
$ whoami
bandit33
```

We are no longer forced to work with uppercase letters, and we discovered with the command `whoami` that we are actually user bandit33.
We can therefore directly get the password for level 33:

```
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
```

The password for level 33 is: c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
