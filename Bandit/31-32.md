# Level 31 &rarr; Level 32

For this level we are again given a git repo to inspect.
The cloning of the repo is similar to the previous levels why it is omitted here.

In the repo we discover the file *repo/README.md*:

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit$ cd repo
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

```

This time the readme file is helpful and tells us what the task is.
Before beginning the task, we look for any hidden files, such as any *.gitignore* file:

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ ls -al
total 20
drwxr-sr-x 3 bandit31 root 4096 Mar  7 02:02 .
drwxr-sr-x 3 bandit31 root 4096 Mar  7 02:02 ..
drwxr-sr-x 8 bandit31 root 4096 Mar  7 02:02 .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 bandit31 root    6 Mar  7 02:02 .gitignore
-rw-r--r-- 1 bandit31 root  147 Mar  7 02:02 README.md
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ cat .gitignore 
*.txt
```

We do indeed discover a *.gitignore* file which makes git ignore files with a .txt suffix.
To solve this task we therefore delete the *.gitignore* file and then use vim to create the file that was asked for in *README.md*:

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ rm .gitignore
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ vim key.txt
```

We verify that *key.txt* is visible using the command `git status`:

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    .gitignore

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	key.txt
```

It is indeed visible, so now we can stage and commit the file to finally push the commit to the remote repository:

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ git add key.txt 
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/coolgit/repo$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   key.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    .gitignore
