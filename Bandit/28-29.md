# Level 28 &rarr; Level 29

Like the last the level, the password is found within given git repo.
We start with cloning the git repo:

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...

```

We then inspect the files within *repo*:

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo$ ls repo/
README.md
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo$ cat repo/README.md 
# Bandit Notes

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx

```

Unlike last level, the password is no longer in the readme file.
We inspect the git log of the repo to check for clues:

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo/repo$ git log

commit b67405defc6ef44210c53345fc953e6a21338cc7
Author: Ben Dover <noone@overthewire.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 16 14:00:39 2018 +0200

    initial commit of README.md
```

We find 3 comits in the git log. First we have the initial commit, then some missing data was added in the second commit, and finally an info leak was fixed in the latest commit.
The password is therefore likely to be in the first or second commit. We check the first commit using `git checkout` with part of the commit's hash and read *README.md* again:

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo/repo$ git checkout b67405defc6
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo/repo$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: <TBD>

```

This time the password is not hidden, but simply not determined yet. We therefore check *README.md* in the second commit:

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo/repo$ git checkout 186a1038c
Previous HEAD position was b67405d... initial commit of README.md
HEAD is now at 186a103... add missing data
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/newgitrepo/repo$ cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes

## credentials

```

The password for level 29 is: bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
