# Level 19 &rarr; Level 20

It is known that we can gain access to level 20 by using the setuid binary in the home directory.

We first learn how to use it by running it without arguments:

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

We learn that it runs a command as another user.
By running the example, we find out exactly which user it is:

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

We can see that the setuid binary changes the effective UID to user bandit20.

We can therefore directly read the password for level 20 in the file */etc/bandit_pass/bandit20* using the setuid binary:

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```

The password for level 20 is: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
