# Level 30 &rarr; Level 31

For this level we are again given a git repo to inspect.
The cloning of the repo is similar to the previous levels why it is omitted here.

Within the git repo we find a single file *repo/README.md*:

```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/radgitdir$ cat repo/README.md 
just an epmty file... muahaha
```

This time the readme file is not so helpful.
I did not find any clues in the git logs or other branches.
I began searching in the *repo/.git/* directory, where a read the file *packed-refs*:

```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/radgitdir$ cat repo/.git/packed-refs 
# pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled 
3aa4c239f729b07deb99a52f125893e162daac9e refs/remotes/origin/master
f17132340e8ee6c159e0a4a6bc6f80e1da3b1aea refs/tags/secret
```

In this file we find "refs/tags/secret" which seems highly suspicious, so I listed the tags of the project:

```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/radgitdir/repo$ git tag
secret
```

We found a tag called secret.
We can inspect the tag with the `git show secret` command:

```
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/radgitdir/repo$ git show secret
47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
```

We found the password.
The password for level 31 is: 47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
