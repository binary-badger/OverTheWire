# Level 5 &rarr; Level 6

It is given that the password is stored in a file with the following properties:
 
 * Not executable.
 * A size of 1033 bytes.
 * Human-readable.

The `find` command can be used to find the names of files that satisfy the first two properties.
The `-size 1033c` specifies that the files must have a size of 1033 bytes, and the `\! -executable`
option specifies that files must not be executable.
Running the find command with these options, it is revealed that only one file satisfy the first two properties.
We can therefore display the password without checking for the third property:

```
bandit5@bandit:~$ find ./inhere/ -size 1033c \! -executable
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
```

The password for level 6 is: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
