# Level 26 &rarr; Level 27

When gaining terminal access to bandit26 (see Bandit/25-26.md) we discover a program in the home directory:

```
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
```

We run *bandit27-do* without arguments to check if we get any info about its usage:

```
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit27-do id
```

We learn it is a program to run commands as another user (in this case it is most probably user bandit27).

We can now easily read the password for user bandit27 with the given program:

```
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
```

The password for level 27 is: 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
