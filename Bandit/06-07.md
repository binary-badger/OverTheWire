# Level 6 &rarr; Level 7

It is given that the password is stored somewhere on the server and has the following properties:

* Owned by user bandit7
* Owned by group bandit6
* 33 bytes in size

The `find` command can be used to locate the file with the option `-user bandit7` to specify the owning user, the option `-group bandit6` to specify the owning group, and the option `-size 33c` to specify the size to be 33 bytes.
The command is executed on the root folder to search as widely as possible, and to avoid displaying permission denied errors stderr gets redirected to */dev/null*.

```
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

The file was located successfully. We print its content to reveal the password:

```
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
```

The password for level 7 is: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
