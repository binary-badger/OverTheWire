# Level 27 &rarr; Level 28

For this level we are given a URL for a git repo to clone and we are informed that the password is that same as the password for level 27.
The password for level 28 is then located in a file in the repo.

We create a directory in */tmp/* to clone the repo within, clone the repo, provide the password and read the password for level 28:

```
bandit27@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/mygitdir
bandit27@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/mygitdir
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/mygitdir$ git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo
