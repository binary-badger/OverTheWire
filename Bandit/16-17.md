# Level 16 &rarr; Level 17

It is known that the credentials for level 17 can be retrieved by submitting the password of level 16 to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.
It is our task to identify which ports speak SSL and find the one port that does not simply send back whatever was sent to it.

First we try to identify the correct port using nmap.
We know the correct port speaks SSL, so we try to find which services are listening to the ports in the given range:

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV -p31000-32000 localhost

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-03-06 00:00 CET

```

Using nmap we find two listening services: one is ssl/echo and the other is ssl/unknown.
Nmap reports a reponse from the unknown ssl service from which we can read, that it states the provided password is wrong, and that we should enter the correct password.
This error message tells us that the service behaves correctly by requesting the correct password and not simply sending whatever it was given back to us.

From previous testing it is learned that the service provides the credentials as a private SSH key instead of a password.
To use this private key to log in as user bandit17, we save the credentials to a file.
This is done by connecting to the service with `openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790` and pasting the password for level 16 into the input prompt while directing the output to a file with write permissions in the */tmp* folder:

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/mycreds
bandit16@bandit:~$ touch /tmp/mycreds/creds
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 > /tmp/mycreds/creds
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify return:1
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
```

The file with the private SSH key also contain other outputs.
We edit the file and remove all non-credential text:

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ vim /tmp/mycreds/creds
bandit16@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/mycreds/creds

The command `ssh` demands safer permissions for the file `/tmp/mycreds/creds` before it is acceptable as a private SSH key.
We set these permissions for the file and log in as user bandit17 with the credentials:

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ chmod 600 /tmp/mycreds/creds
bandit16@bandit:~$ ssh -i /tmp/mycreds/creds bandit17@localhost
Could not create directory '/home/bandit16/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
(...)
bandit17@bandit:~$ 
```

As user bandit17, we can now easily reveal the password:
```
bandit17@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
```

The password for level 17 is: xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
