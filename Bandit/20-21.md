# Level 20 &rarr; Level 21

It is known that there is a setuid binary *suconnect* that makes a connection to localhost on a specified port given as a commandline argument.
If the binary recieves the password for level 20 from the connection, it sends the password for level 21 back over that connection.

To solve this problem, we can create our own netcat process listening on a specified port, which allows us to connect the binary to the same port.
From the netcat process, we can then send the password for level 20 such that the binary gives us the password for level 21.

First we create the netcat process that listens on port 4242, suspend the process, and then let it run in the background:

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost
listening on [any] 4242 ...
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost
bandit20@bandit:~$ bg 1
[1]+ nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost &
```

Next we connect the setuid binary to the same port and suspend it:

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 4242
connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 53650
^Z
[2]+  Stopped                 ./suconnect 4242
```

We now run the netcat process in the foreground, send the password for level 20, and suspend the process:

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ fg 1
nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost
```

Now we run the setuid binary in the foreground to check if it recieved the correct password:

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ fg 2
./suconnect 4242
Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password
```

We can verify that it recieved the correct password and sends the password for level 21 back to the netcat process.
We now run the netcat process in the foreground to read the password:

```
bandit20@bandit:~$ fg 1
nc -l -v -p 4242 localhost
gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
```

The password for level 21 is: gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
