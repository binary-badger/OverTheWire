We find the *repo/README.md* file which contains a message telling us that no passwords are in production.
This is seems to hint, that there are other branches in the git repo.
We look for other branches:

```
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/thegitrepo/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

We checkout the dev branch:

```
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/thegitrepo/repo$ git checkout dev
Branch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/thegitrepo/repo$ ls

bandit29@bandit:/tmp/thegitrepo/repo$ cat README.md
